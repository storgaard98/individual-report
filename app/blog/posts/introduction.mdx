**Personal Learning Goals**

Throughout the course, we were encouraged to choose personal learning goals, which are areas we wanted to improve upon and that could contribute to the project 
we were working on during the course. I chose project management and green coding as my goals. I chose project management to improve my ability to structure my work weekly 
and overall, including managing deadlines and tasks. Green coding intrigued me after an inspiring lecture by Henrik BÃ¦rbak, 
and I wanted to be more thoughtful about coding practices.

**New Study Group Dynamics**

As the new semester started, I joined a new study group. I had worked with Frederikke before, but Giuseppe was an exchange student from Politecnico di Milano. 
He brought a different skill set than myself and my fellow students, which excited me about the potential for learning and collaboration. 
Our study group also adopted different tools and practices; for instance, Giuseppe used Figma extensively, 
and while I had only used it a few times in previous courses, we agreed to use Figma as our main workspace.
