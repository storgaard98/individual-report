The first challenge of the course was set by our professors: to conduct a living experiment with the theme of sustainability. Initially, I was skeptical and didn't see the value in this exercise. Discussing it with my fellow students, who shared similar reservations, didn't help much either. However, we began brainstorming together and I decided to try living as a vegan for a week. Although it might not seem very challenging at first glance, my motivation for the experiment was not particularly high. I convinced my girlfriend to join me in the experiment, though she was not thrilled since many of our favorite dishes are not vegan. This meant we had to find new inspiration for our meals.

I started planning the experiment by searching the internet for recipes. It was overwhelming as finding a recipe that looked appealing was difficult. I turned to ChatGPT for help, which provided me with a detailed meal plan and a grocery shopping list.

To the right, you can see a table with our meal plan, although it is in Danish. We decided to shop at Føtex because we believed their range of vegan items was larger than Rema and Netto’s. However, when we started shopping, we realized that not all products were clearly labeled as vegan. This meant we had to read labels carefully, place some products back, and search for suitable alternatives. We spent about an hour in Føtex and only managed to buy groceries for one day. This experience dampened our motivation for the week-long vegan experiment.

## Day 1: Monday

I began the day with oatmeal and oat milk, which was so sweet it made me nauseous. I struggled through my portion and hoped lunch would be better. After that, I headed to CrossFit, and although the nausea subsided a bit, it was still present. It was not the best start to my vegan week. A long shopping trip to Føtex that didn’t go as planned and a terrible first meal was discouraging. At the university, I shared my morning experience with my study group, who suggested I try almond milk instead of oat milk due to its sweetness. For lunch, I went back to Føtex, better prepared this time, and bought what I needed with the help of a fellow student experienced in vegan shopping.

In the evening, I prepared dinner for my girlfriend and me. We had bought ingredients for Dahl, and we made a big portion to have leftovers for lunch the next day.

As the week progressed, we became better at shopping and finding delicious recipes, often asking friends for inspiration. However, I noticed that my recovery time after training increased from one day to three days, likely due to the lower protein intake. This required me to adjust my exercise routine.

The week was tough, and my mood, according to my fellow students and girlfriend, was not great. Whether it was due to the food or the disruption of our usual diet, the experiment was challenging. However, after the initial weeks, I realized it wasn’t that bad. I discovered some new dishes that I would make again, and my attitude towards meatless and vegan dishes changed. Now, we often have 2-3 days a week without meat, and sometimes even entirely vegan days. Although it’s still challenging to be completely vegan in Denmark, it is feasible compared to other countries. While we may not eliminate meat from our diet anytime soon, having only two days with meat each week is a realistic possibility.
