**Reflections and Takeaways**

The course has been a learning journey for me, marked by both challenges and achievements. My primary reflections revolve around the personal growth 
I experienced in project management, green coding, and collaborative teamwork. Setting and pursuing learning goals allowed me to gain deeper insights into areas 
I was passionate about and directly apply this knowledge to our project.

One of the key lessons I learned was the importance of structured planning and clear communication within the team. 
By creating a detailed 10-week project plan and implementing daily stand-up meetings, we maintained a clear direction and fostered effective collaboration. 
Another takeaway was the concept of green coding. Henrik BÃ¦rbak's lecture was inspiring, and I wanted to explore how I could develop software with sustainability in mind. 
Concepts such as caching data and different hosting methods are aspects of green coding I learned that can reduce the environmental impact of web applications.

Looking ahead, the new knowledge I gained through the course is something I can use in future projects. Throughout the semester, 
I contributed to our project by taking the role of project manager, organizing our work, setting deadlines, and ensuring we stayed on track. 
I also configured GitHub for version control and streamlined workflows. As the project progressed, 
I transitioned into a tech lead role, overseeing the architecture of our prototype and guiding the development process. 
I mentored Frederikke in Next.js and introduced Giuseppe to HTML and CSS.

In summary, this course has equipped me with practical skills in project management, sustainable coding practices, and team collaboration, see Figure 5 for an amazing study group.
