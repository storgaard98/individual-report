The course has been a learning journey for me, marked by both challenges and achievements. My primary reflections revolve around the personal growth, I experienced in project management, green coding, and collaborative teamwork. Setting and pursuing learning goals allowed me to gain deeper insights into areas I was passionate about and directly apply this knowledge to our project.

One of the key lessons I learned was the importance of structured planning and clear communication within the team, by creating a detailed 10-week project plan and implementing daily stand-up meetings. Another takeaway was the concept of green coding. The lecture by Henerik BÃ¦rbak was inspiring and I wanted to explore the subject, of how can I develop software with sustainability in mind. Concepts such as caching data and different hosting methods are some aspects of green coding I have learned that can reduce the environmental impact of web applications. Looking ahead the new knowledge that I have gained through the course, is something that I can use in future projects. Throughout the semester, I contributed to our project, taking the role of project manager, organizing our project, setting deadlines, and ensuring that we stayed on track. GitHub configurations for version control and streamlining workflows. I transitioned into a tech lead role, overseeing the architecture of our prototype and guiding the development process, mentoring Frederikke in Next.js, and introducing Giuseppe to HTML and CSS. In summary, this course has equipped me with practical skills in project management, sustainable coding practices, and team collaboration.
